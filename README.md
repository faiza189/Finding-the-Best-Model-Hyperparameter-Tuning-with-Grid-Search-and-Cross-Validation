# Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV and Cross-Validation

This tutorial presents a complete hands-on guide to hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Cross-Validation in `scikit-learn`. It focuses on optimizing two classifiers ‚Äî Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ‚Äî using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The goal is to show students how to systematically improve model performance while avoiding common tuning pitfalls like overfitting and data leakage.

## üìÅ Contents

- `hyperparameter_tuning_tutorial.ipynb`: Complete notebook with theory, implementation, and evaluation
- `README.md`: This file, including instructions and project overview
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies to run the notebook
- `tutorial.docx` or `tutorial.pdf`: (Optional) Written report for academic submission
- `LICENSE`: (Optional) Open-source license

## üìä Dataset

We use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset available in `scikit-learn`. It contains:
- 569 samples
- 30 numeric features
- Binary target: malignant (1) or benign (0)

It is well-suited for classification and supports learning concepts like model tuning, scaling, and validation.

## üß† Key Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between hyperparameters and model parameters
- Apply Grid Search (`GridSearchCV`) to tune SVM and KNN classifiers
- Use cross-validation to evaluate generalization performance
- Compare models visually and interpret results with confusion matrices and reports

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hyperparameter-tuning.git
cd hyperparameter-tuning
```

2. Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch the notebook:
